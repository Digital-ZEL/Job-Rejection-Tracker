## 🚀 Next Steps for Deployment

### Step 1: Install Node.js
1. Download Node.js LTS from https://nodejs.org/
2. Install with default settings
3. Verify installation by opening a new terminal and running:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

### Step 2: Run Setup Script
**Option A - Windows (Recommended):**
1. Double-click `setup-backend.bat` in the main project folder
2. Follow the on-screen instructions

**Option B - Manual Setup:**
```bash
cd first-job-tracker/backend
npm install
```

### Step 3: Test Your Setup
```bash
cd first-job-tracker/backend
npm run test-setup
```

### Step 4: Start the Server
```bash
# Development mode (with auto-restart)
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

## 🔒 Production Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, complete these critical security steps:

- [ ] **Update JWT_SECRET** in `backend/.env` to a strong random string
- [ ] **Update CORS_ORIGINS** in `backend/.env` to include your production domain(s)
- [ ] **Set NODE_ENV=production** in `backend/.env`
- [ ] **Review rate limiting** settings in `backend/.env`
- [ ] **Test all API endpoints** locally first
- [ ] **Verify database permissions** and backup strategy

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

Once the backend server is running:

1. **Health Check:** Visit http://localhost:3001/api/health
2. **API Test:** Try registering a user:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/register \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'
   ```

## 🌐 Frontend Integration

The frontend works independently but can connect to the backend:

1. **Frontend Only:** Open `index.html` directly in any browser
2. **Full Features:** Ensure backend is running and update frontend to use API endpoints

## 📦 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Static Hosting + API Server
- Host frontend files on Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages
- Deploy backend on Heroku, AWS, or any Node.js hosting
- Update CORS settings to allow your frontend domain

### Option 2: All-in-One Deployment
- Deploy the entire application on a VPS or cloud server
- Use PM2 for process management
- Set up nginx as a reverse proxy

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Port in use:** Change PORT in `.env` or kill the process using that port
2. **Permission errors:** Ensure the application has write access to the directory
3. **Module not found:** Run `npm install` in the backend directory
4. **Database locked:** Check file permissions on `job_tracker.db`

**Get Help:**
- Run `npm run test-setup` to diagnose issues
- Check console output for detailed error messages
- Refer to `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for detailed guidance
